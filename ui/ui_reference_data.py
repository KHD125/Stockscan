"""CONCEPT_REFERENCE — plain-language meaning of every CATEGORICAL VALUE-LABEL PRISM shows.

The glossary (_RAW_GLOSSARY) explains the column NAMES (e.g. "Moat", "PEG Zone"); this explains the
VALUE OUTCOMES those columns take (Wealth Creator, Deep Value, Stage 2, …) — the labels you see on a
Tear-Sheet / All-Data cell that the glossary alone never defines. Grouped by category.

ACCURACY CONTRACT: every explanation is DERIVED FROM THE CODE that produces the label — each category
block cites its `file:line (np.select)` source. Do not edit a meaning without re-reading that source.
Coverage of the filterable sets is pinned by tests/test_concept_reference.py (cross-checked to the
live ui_discovery filters), and a 40-char quality floor guards against shallow entries.

Pure data — zero Streamlit. Rendered by ui_reference.render_concepts(); surfaced in the 📖 Reference tab.
