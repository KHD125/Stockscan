"""PRISM — 🔁 Movers: what changed between two data vintages.

The engine's whole thesis is that DIRECTION beats level (Vel%, the 28th WCS), yet every other
surface shows one instant. This module diffs two vintages of the scored frame — the live sheet
against an archived Drive copy — and reports the moves: wealth-tier upgrades, soundness flips,
rank jumps, new gate passers, red-flag rises, fresh results.

THREE RULES THIS MODULE IS BUILT ON
  1. Same engine on both sides, by construction. The caller re-scores the archived RAW copy with
     the running engine (app.py `_load_vintage`), so a difference can only be "the company
     changed" — never "PRISM changed". A scored file from the past would confound the two.
  2. Never a fabricated delta. A stock present on one side only is NEW or DROPPED; a NaN on
     either side of a numeric column drops that row from that section. No sentinels, no fillna
     into a delta (CLAUDE.md semantic-truth mandate). `.eq(1)` treats NaN as "not a move".
  3. Zero scoring logic and zero mutation. Reads columns compute_verdict / run_full_scoring
     already produce; works on column subsets; both inputs come back byte-identical.

STATELESS, like ui_tearsheet: no st.button/slider/number_input, no st.columns/st.metric — the
header strip is inline flex. Widgets (the vintage picker, the compare button) live in app.py.
