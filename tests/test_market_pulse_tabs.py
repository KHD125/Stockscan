"""Contract: the Market Pulse inner-tab set, pinned so a tab cannot be re-added — or a removed
renderer re-wired — without a conscious change.

STAGE 3 (2026-06-18) cut the set to {Tsunami, QGLP, Sectors}, dropping 💙 Blue Chips (fired on 0%
of the universe — dead) and 🚀 Tipping Points (brittle; folded into an enhanced Sectors view).
Those two stay out, and the renderer checks below are what keep them out.

🔭 MOSL ADDED 2026-08-27, and this file did its job: the change failed here first and had to be
justified rather than slipped in. Neither Stage-3 removal reason applies to it —

    not dead      586 stocks clear 2+ of the 10 Wealth Creation lenses; a clean pyramid from
                  999 at zero down to 1 stock at eight; deepest agreement 8 of 10
    not brittle   a VIEW over frameworks already implemented and audited, with no new gate and no
                  engine change; exact-token parsed and cross-checked against the authoritative
                  qglp_pass column (both 328)
    not redundant corr(convergence, composite_score) = 0.479 — it carries information the score
                  does not

💹 WEALTH ADDED 2026-08-27 (same session, later), and again this file forced the justification:
    not dead      every one of its six tiers is populated on live data (BUY★ 12% · BUY 5% ·
                  WATCH★ 9% · WATCH 32% · AVOID 34% · N/A 8%) — pinned by tests/test_wealth_tier.py
    not brittle   a pure READ of the wealth_* columns compute_verdict materializes; the tab holds
                  zero logic, so the tier a snapshot captures equals the tier displayed
    not redundant it answers the question no other surface does — "is it becoming more valuable?"
                  — and provably does not collapse into verdict_direction (the engine's complete
                  18-stock BUY list splits across four wealth tiers)

🏭 INDUSTRY ADDED 2026-08-28, and it clears the same three bars:
    not dead      76 industries hold ≥8 stocks (54 at ≥10) out of 355 — against 81 sectors, so the
                  view is 4.4× finer and still well populated at its default floor
    not brittle   a pure groupby over columns that already exist (industry, sector,
                  composite_score, gate_pass). No new gate, no engine change, nothing to calibrate
    not redundant THE STRONGEST CASE OF THE FOUR. Sector averaging destroys real dispersion: the
                  six sizeable industries inside Pharmaceuticals run 18.1 → 51.3 on average
                  composite — a 33-point spread the Sectors tab reports as ONE number (FMCG 22.9,
                  Auto Ancillaries 22.6). 20 of those 76 industries sit more than 5 points from
                  their parent sector's average, from Pharma - MNC bulk Drugs at +22.7 to Auto
                  Ancillaries - Gears at −12.9. The tab makes that gap its sort key.
                  Note it is NOT a drill-down: 136 of 355 industries span more than one sector, so
                  the hierarchy the name suggests does not exist — see tests/test_industry_tab.py.

The behaviour of the tabs themselves is pinned by tests/test_mosl_convergence_tab.py and
tests/test_wealth_tier.py. This file pins only the SET, which is the thing a future edit is most
likely to change carelessly.
