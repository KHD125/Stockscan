"""How fresh is the data? — read from the spreadsheet's own name.

The ingestion pipeline renames the sheet after every load to the trading session
its numbers came from, e.g. "PRISM 2026-08-28 Fri". Google returns that name in
the export endpoint's Content-Disposition header, so the app can report data
freshness without a Drive API, credentials, or an extra column in the sheet.

DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FROM data_engine.load_all_datasets. That loader is locked
(CLAUDE.md §0) because a past change to it silently nulled 5 of 6 tabs. A
cosmetic freshness label must never be able to break data loading, so this
module opens its own one-byte request and shares nothing with the load path.

Everything here fails soft: a network hiccup or an unexpected sheet name costs
you a label, never a render.
